# micr0 shell
`micr0 shell` is a Python script that dynamically generates PIC Null-Free reverse shell shellcode. It is light, convenient, and fast. Generated shellcode can be `27 bytes` smaller than MSF's shellcode (Do not contain `0x00`) at most, depending on supplied shellcode options. Generated shellcode can also be used to evade signature-based detection, considering MSF's shellcode is used widely.


## Background

## How to Use
### Install Keystone Engine


### Script Usage
The user can supply the IP address, listening port, variable name, shellcode format(C/CSharp/python/powershell), shell type(powershell/cmd), and whether to execute generated shellcode(True/False).

To make the shellcode work well, only the `IP address` must be specified. The default port value is `443`, the default variable name is `buf`, the default language is `python`, the default shell type is `cmd.exe`, and generated shellcode is `Not Executed` by default.

### Simple Shellcode Runner
#### C
```c

```

#### Csharp
```csharp

```

#### PowerShell
```powershell

```

#### Python
```python

```

## Known Issues
1. According to the supplied IP address, port, and shell type, micr0 shell dynamically generates Null-Free shellcode. I have considered most of the common situations that could generate Null bytes, however, I am aware that if the supplied IP address contains `.255` and `.0` at the same time, for instance, if the IP address is `192.168.0.255`, generated shellcode will contain Null byte. This type of IP address could be rare in practice, and eliminating Null byte for all IP addresses would add more complexity. Therefore, I do not intend to improve this part recently.

2. Regarding the port value, in theory, any port will not generate Null byte. However, due to the implementation of eliminating Null-byte, port `65280` is not usable.

## Future Plan


## Test Case

```cmd
─# python3 micr0shell.py --ip 192.168.1.45 --port 443 --type cmd --language csharp --variable sc --execution false --save True --output sc.bin
